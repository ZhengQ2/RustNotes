# Statement
- Perform some action and do not return a value 
- Semicolon at the end 
    e.g. `x = 1;`
    > Note: Since statement does not return a value, things like `x = y = 1;` is not allowed.  

# Expression
- Evaluates to a resulting value  
- No semicolon at the end  
    e.g. `1 + 2` 
    > Note: However, `1 + 2;` is not an expression, but a statement.  

> Conclusion: Expression is usually a part of a statement.  
> Example:
> `let sum = a + b;` is an statement while inside it, the `a + b` is an expression
