# Program Memory
- Stack
  - Similar to a stack of different size of boxes
  - Value stored in sequential order
  - Data added and removed as last in, first out (LIFO)
  - Used when declare local variables and call functions etc
  - Data can be pushed or pulled quickly
  - Access data quickly
  - Small size
  - Must be a known fixed size at compile time
- Heap
  - Similar to a warehouse stores boxes
  - Allocating new memory from heap when needed
  - Adding and accessing data is slower
  - Dynamically add and remove memory blocks

# Pointer
- Data type stores a memory address
- Similar to an inventory sheet, telling where to fix a specific box
