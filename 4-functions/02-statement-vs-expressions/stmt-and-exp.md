# Statement
- Perform some action and do not return a value 
- Semicolon at the end 
    e.g. <code>x = 1;</code>  
    > Note: Since statement does not return a value, things like <code>x = y = 1;</code> is not allowed.  

# Expression
- Evaluates to a resulting value  
- No semicolon at the end  
    e.g. <code>1 + 2</code>  
    > Note: However, <code>1 + 2;</code> is not an expression, but a statement.  

> Conclusion: Expression is usually a part of a statement.  
> Example:
> <code>let sum = a + b;</code> is an statement while inside it, the <code>a + b</code> is an expression
